## Automated Resume Relevance Scoring (n8n)

### Overview
Built an end-to-end automated workflow using n8n to evaluate resume relevance for a given role.
The system parses resumes, extracts structured data, applies rule-based scoring, and uses AI
to assess relevance — producing clean, repeatable outputs.

### Workflow Steps
1. Resume ingestion (PDF input)
2. Document parsing and text extraction
3. AI-based relevance evaluation
4. Rule-based scoring logic
5. Structured output generation

### Tools & Tech
- n8n (Workflow Automation)
- AI APIs (LLM-based evaluation)
- PDF Parsing
- JSON-based outputs

### How to Use
- Import the `.json` workflow into n8n
- Configure API keys via environment variables
- Run workflow manually or via trigger
